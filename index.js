////////////////  LightCoin (LHL) Crypto App  ////////////////
// List of features :
// Allow multiple accounts to be created
// Each account can have many transactions
// Allow withdrawals and deposits into accounts
// Allow us to retrieve the transaction history of an account (all withdrawals and deposits)
// Allow us to retrieve the current balance of the account at any time
// Don't allow withdrawals that exceed the remaining balance of the account
